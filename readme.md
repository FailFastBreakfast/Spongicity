# Urban Flood Mitigation

Our solution to the hackathon is a platform supported by a mathematical model.

The MVP of our model and exhaustive domain research can be found in the spreadsheet in this repository `Urban Flood Challenge.xlsx`. This model is capable of computing the general effectiveness of mitigations under a simplified scenario.

Our next vision was to extend this model in code with more parameters, including particular needs per city block and the water flow between them.
Due to time constraints, we were not able to fully develop the mathemetical aspect of this model, but the relationships between the entities described in this model (`types.ts`) have helped form the key selling point of our platform : the stakeholder interaction.
